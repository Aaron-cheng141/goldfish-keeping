        <h1>My Goldfish Keeping Journey</h1>
        <p>Welcome! This page explores my experiences and passion for goldfish keeping.</p>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>How It All Started</h2>
            <p>My interest in fishkeeping started with my father and uncles, who kept fish like Sabah Kaloi and Koi. When I was 7, my father brought me to an aquarium shop and bought me guppies, sparking my first journey into fishkeeping. 
            At that time, my father believed goldfish required an oxygen pump, so he didnâ€™t allow me to keep them until I was 11, when I got my first small Orandas. 
            I stopped keeping fish for a while, but at 13, after watching videos from Chinese goldfish keepers and sellers, I was inspired to restart my journey. 
            Since then, I have been drawn to high-quality goldfish like Thai Orandas, Ryukin, and Ranchu, especially those imported around Chinese New Year.</p>

            <h2>Types of Goldfish I Keep</h2>
            <p>My collection includes China and Thai Ranchu, Thai Orandas, and Ryukin.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>My Goldfish Setup</h2>
            <p>I use a black fiber 8-feet tank, which can accommodate about 30-40 goldfish.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Challenges in Goldfish Keeping</h2>
            <p>The most common issue I face is white dots caused by temperature changes. The most serious disease is dropsy, which is similar to cancer in fish, and I have yet to find a cure.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Tips for Beginners</h2>
            <p>Avoid small tanks or bowls for goldfish. Square tanks are best, and circular wall tanks should be avoided. A rough guideline is 10 gallons of water per goldfish.</p>

            <h2>My Goldfish Breeding Experience</h2>
            <p>After my final school exam in 2018, I attempted hand-spawning goldfish for the first time. Some eggs spoiled, turning white instead of staying transparent. I sought advice from a goldfish group on Facebook and learned new techniques to improve hatch rates. 
            Additionally, feeding two-month-old goldfish fries was challenging. I had to hatch brine shrimp eggs and filter out the inedible eggshells. I created a DIY brine shrimp hatchery using a water bottle, a plastic tube, and a filtering system to extract the brine shrimp. 
            Despite the challenges, I found breeding goldfish to be an exciting and rewarding experience.</p>
